      <p>
        I'm a Software Engineer that has been coding since 2017, and since 2018
        I've been coding for a living!
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional experience is mostly on back-end projects, but
        fortunately I've had the change to work on a few front-end projects as
        well during my career, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practicing front-end development is part of my study routine. I'm always
        keeping an eye to find new tools and catching up to new standards in the
        software engineering industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mostly recently I've been studying Cloud Computing, Docker, and Linux.
